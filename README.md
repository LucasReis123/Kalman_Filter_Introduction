## Description

This project implements a Kalman Filter to estimate the position, velocity, and acceleration of an object based on acceleration measurements in two dimensions: X and Y. The Kalman Filter is a recursive estimation algorithm widely used in tracking systems, process control, and other applications involving estimation and prediction.

## Functionalities

- Generation of 200 random acceleration measurements in X and Y within specified intervals.
- Utilization of the Kalman Filter to estimate the position, velocity, and acceleration of the object.
- Generation of plots to visualize the results, including:
  - Plot of position in X and Y over time.
  - Plot of velocity in X and Y over time.
  - Plot of acceleration in X and Y over time.

## Prerequisites
- Library Python: NumPy, Matplotlib
